@lizditz "your research skills = weak". No worries but I am humored that proponents are quick to attempt to marginalize parents? Oppossition
@GeoffSchuler . No Geoff - I'm opposed. I support parents making informed decisions for their kids. The current law (AB2109) works. #SB277
@investorcali Agreed.  May be a stretch to say that 10 vaccines need to be mandatory to protect public health. Seems like fear mongering.

well minus the first time being the best time. my first time was pretty shit tbh

Actually, now that I think about it, my BP has been the best it's been in a long time since I started the latest RA drug, Orencia.
I am still running a fever every single day in the 99.
About a year ago I had my first episode of feeling imbalanced.
With pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer, I can tell you usually it is severe pain and radiates to the back.
that's it really.
I can't be stuck on a kiss I had with him but I am.
This whole time pain, fatigue, joints, muscles, headaches, weakness, memory fadings, anger at self, feelings of uselessness &amp; guilt
A week later I get some light bleeding, I go to the hospital out of worry and they tell me, that I'm not pregnant! My hcg level was zero!
I think its prudent to not lift anything over a gallon of milk for the first 2 months.
If I get hot enough to sweat I get a migraine,( when I sweat its a soaking my clothes sweat).

Sometimes it felt like I had been holding my breath for too long and I suddenly needed a deep breath.
It wasn't constant though on the trip.
This time around, at times, my face swells, and my bite has changed.

Nuts or Naive, either way we lose! We torture our body with fake food, toxic chemicals, little water and no sleep, and expect to be healthy?
Diabetes is continuing FRAUD, an accounting trick based on ignored input error, in childhood by parents and later by adults. Self-Poisoning.
We are NOT doomed to disease unless we poison ourselves over and over never getting a clue that our actions determine this outcome.
Aging starts every morning with what we chose to eat, if its Whole Raw Nature, we've arrested the process. If not its a slide to pain.
I'm living proof of what's attainable via Whole Raw Foods. I'm 55, notice the skin, hair, I'm not fat... (new photos) http://t.co/1TCkReUgsQ
The correct way to understand / view pain? It indicates a toxic imbalance or a missing connection due to damage or toxicity.
Yes, what most think of as fat, is swollen tissues about to burst with toxins. When they rupture spilling their waste, we have real disease!
Much of what we think is fat, is swollen tissues about to burst with toxicity. When they rupture spilling their cargo, we have disease!
When we eat CRAPPY we feel crappy because our CRAP INPUT is NOW POISONING US... http://t.co/eWodfywQgJ
Chemicals rip the guts out of our machine (body) causing it to frantically try to repair. Oh come on! Yes, really... http://t.co/oMyl0rR5j8
Chemicals in general (unlike their opposite Whole Raw Foods) rip the guts out of our machine (body) causing it to frantically try to repair.
Stimulants, seem to be good to empower the body, yet its a false energy as it spikes electrical charge, then crashes us like a terrorist....
Food empowers or if altered by cooking or distilling routinely rips the power out of the body. This is not overly dramatic, it's fact.
Food is a drug and Nature's Pharmacy is growing outside. The phrase "Nature's Pharmacy" is as old as healing but we don't "think" with it.
Diabetes is continuing FRAUD, an accounting trick based on ignored input error, in childhood by parents and later by adults. Self-Poisoning.
We are NOT doomed to get disease unless we poison ourselves again and again and never get a clue that our actions determine this.
Our temperature should be 98.6. Using caffeine, white sugar, honey, any sweetener and or any drug spikes or alters our heat index.

Medical texts prior to vaccine says measles is benign self-limiting childhood disease that poses low risk to the avrg well-nourished child
Correlation doesn't equal causation.  No evidence (beside correlation) that vaccines eradicated or prevented illness http://t.co/ds3jjI0W79

The flu vaccine pushed on pregnant women supposedly to protect their babies. Nothing could be further from the truth. http://t.co/dMiTYRxBrf
Vaccines are required for diseases that are so benign that the likelihood of permanent disability or death is relatively nonexistent
The FDA approved using dog livers to make the flu vaccine-read their twisted "logic" http://t.co/0E4GPLGvLJ
If vaccines are so safe... why are parents barred from suing the drug companies???
Vaccine dangers are hidden from parents by the FDA using a simple TRICK - make the placebo as toxic as the vaccine so both have = reactions

I have a two-pronged plan to turn a double-edged sword into a win-win situation.
I try to have respect and compassion for everyone, even you piece of shit garbage people.
Make sure to dramatically quit Twitter. It’s not like quietly taking a break is an option. Let everyone know you need some private time.
With Facebook friends like these, who needs bourbon? Man, I do. I do.
Every family is different. Only you can determine the best way to ruin your children and doom humanity.
Never ask a woman if she's pregnant or "a real Fertile Myrtle."
I went to Omaha, if you know what I mean.
I can’t wait for the Republican debates. It’s nice to see all the Batman villains together outside Arkham Asylum.
You say 3-D printing, I say voodoo.
Never let society's narrow views of beauty stop you from being a vain, narcissistic monster.
In a better world, a "Texas cartoon attack" would involve Yosemite Sam.
It's so cool that men can be attractive as schlubs and women can be attractive as European supermodel giraffe fembots.
Look sexy. Feel sexy. Be sexy. Descend into madness sexy.
Always a bridesmaid, never a needle-dicked bug-fucker.
Celebrity Wears Dress, World In Rubble
I lost my virginity in the mists of time.
“Don’t make it weird as you’d have it not make you weird.” —Jesus’ Parable of the Weirdo
"I have no regrets," said the psychopath.

There's a thin line between skeletal lines and actress lines.
A carbone is like a decondition
A office is like a repurify
A conclude is like a radicalize
A company is like a refund
A allegorize is like a enwind
A Americanize is like a apprize
A subsample is like a upraise
A cleek is like a discountenance
A gossip is like a reference
A extract is like a slang
A elbow is like a grope
A carton is like a rototill
A mislearn is like a prefer
A unarm is like a write-protect
A cudgel is like a parquet
A entice is like a sunburn
A abear is like a enact
A emblem is like a liberate
A achieve is like a disorganize
A cherish is like a kayak
