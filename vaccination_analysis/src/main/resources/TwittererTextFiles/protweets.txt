@RubalcavaMel thanks that actually means a lot

@RubalcavaMel thanks :)
@RubalcavaMel lmao I cried like a fucking baby I hate that
still can't believe I shared that much with my English class I don't even know them and most of my friend don't even know about that
I'm not saying I'm worthy of lifting mjolnir, but have you seen me not be able to lift mjolnir?
set me free
send me home
I am falling asleep
@TheJimBooth it's a very long story haha
@TheJimBooth and that's fair too. I am a big comic reader and I just don't like how he treated Natasha in the latest movie
@TheJimBooth I can respect that. I understand that you're trying to show people the facts but I just don't like him that much
I like joss' other stuff, I do. I like Buffy and firefly and serenity but...AOU.
@TheJimBooth http://t.co/gaAB5cjhSO
@TheJimBooth *whispers* but he is sexist
@TheJimBooth I'm not saying he's sexist. I'm saying he fucked up Nat.

@remittancegirl @BrewtBlacklist So it really was a coward's snipe attack. A pretty little bit of spittle just for you.
@BrewtBlacklist No, but it puts very little daylight between her and radicalizing imams.
@remittancegirl @BrewtBlacklist Meh. I'm thinking that making a cowardly sniper's hate list is a zero-sum achievement.
@remittancegirl Very grade school playground.
@remittancegirl That is some if the oddest passive aggression I've seen. Novel, for sure. But weak sauce.
One thing places like UAE understand, even if their execution is off. Fossil fuel economies _will_ die if they don't adapt. Sooner or Later.

@craigcalcaterra What's a Tim Conway? Oh, about 120 pounds.
@craigcalcaterra If you know anything about power rankings, you know they are to be updated weekly, indicating who's moving up and down.
@craigcalcaterra I've met a number of royal pains in the ass with that sort of name, though.

I guess Scherzer blew it again. He pitched his team to zero runs, and didn't inspire Werth not to fall on his ass.

@keithlaw Leathersich claims Bobby Parnell taught him to command his fastball. How much does his value tick up if this is true?

@tkmlac @toxicpath @saramayhew You keep talking about "supermajority" GO read.
@tkmlac @toxicpath @saramayhew And yet for the ACA, the Senate had ALL 60 votes of dems. Again, go read.
@tkmlac @toxicpath @saramayhew It takes 60 votes in Senate to overcome a filibuster. 67 is a "supermajority". Yes, go do your reading.
@tkmlac @toxicpath @saramayhew Sorry, not true. All 60 "dems" (including Sanders (I) who caucuses with the dems) voted for the bill.
@tkmlac What? You need a supermajority overcome a veto. Not to pass a bill. Go do some reading. @toxicpath @saramayhew
@toxicpath How's that again? Dems voted 60-40 FOR the ACA. @saramayhew @tkmlac
@saramayhew Political system here is corrupt because of that. @toxicpath @tkmlac
@saramayhew Not really that. it's MONEY. Insurance Cos. have huge lobbies here and donate to campaigns of both parties. @toxicpath @tkmlac
@tkmlac @toxicpath @saramayhew Repubs couldn't have. Senate had a filibuster proof majority (60).
@toxicpath @saramayhew @tkmlac  When the ACA passed? Both houses had Dem majorities. (247/60) Dems could've easily had single payer.

You have to either laugh at or get annoyed with the English establishments mentality towards Scotland. It's one of hypocrisy and ignorance.

@ItsFearHerself Look at The Thing and also They Live. They don't sugar coat the endings for cry babies. They are ambiguous in their finales.
@ItsFearHerself Me too. This is what I liked about John Carpenter movies of the 80s. They ended mostly as a make your own mind up ending.

@ItsFearHerself The idea of him running to help her. Then silence and his body flung into the room was WTF? now it loses it's shock factor.
@ItsFearHerself I'd have preferred to use my imagination to what happened when Demon-Katie killed him. Not for the movie PA: TMO to show us.
@ItsFearHerself I hate when some movies ruin things by showing what happened or telling us. Like what happened to Micah in PA 1 downstairs.

@hydroqueen Trudeau is digging himself a hole really, quickly losing any borderline left wing voters to the NDP
They've made voting in the Federal election a no-brainer
Very disappointed that @Scott_Simms,  and the federal Liberals, are backing Harper's attack on the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
@CochraneCBCNL it's wonderful having the right split the vote for once. Maybe a few Con's can see the problems with FPTP this morning
@seliharris I can't say I'm upset that it went the other way for once. Might get a few con's talking about it.
@seliharris all I know is that the PC's and WR had over 50% between them. Vote splitting is also a hell of a thing.
Betcha the conservative's in Alberta wish they had proportional representation this morning
It's also a shame that young people are so apathetic in NL, the NL NDP would be so much stronger

@AudiByrneHaema Can have all the data in the world, but it pales in comparison to a well-told, emotionally engaging story.
@AudiByrneHaema Just generally, talking about the data and the evidence doesn't tend to work. Seems cold, distant, uncaring.
@AudiByrneHaema I see it largely as a communication style issue, rather than necessarily content. Message needs to be personal.
@AudiByrneHaema I agree it is up to parents to get away from AV views. Only so much science/medicine can do to reassure.
@AudiByrneHaema I agree with your premise (a) to a degree, it's the (b) that I'm not convinced about after seeing how goalposts shift.
@AudiByrneHaema You already have that with current situation. Science/medical community trying to reassure parents, AV sowing doubt.
@AudiByrneHaema I understand what you're saying, but the anti-vax group needs to be considered, since they'll be influencing others, too.
Would also need strong suggestive evidence that there is some link. @AudiByrneHaema
In order for precautionary principle to apply, hypothetical risk from vaccine would have to be greater than from disease. @AudiByrneHaema
.@AudiByrneHaema Also, don't think that expanding medical exemption w/o good evidence of risk will improve situation.
.@AudiByrneHaema Agree listening to concerns and addressing them important for that population, but won't convince anti-vaccine ideologues.
I agree that it's important to listen to parents' concerns, but I don't see the anti-vax arguments going away, just morphing @AudiByrneHaema
They will always use spurious arguments and fear-laced rhetoric that will convince some parents to leave kids at risk. @AudiByrneHaema
What it basically comes down to, @AudiByrneHaema, is that as long as there are vaccines, there will always be a vocal minority opposed.
